##  Yura Yastrebov  

I started my career as a digital design engineer. Over 7 years of experience working on the development of firmware for the digital circuits and control system for the digital led screens. As a hobby i designed a corporate web-application using wordpress and became fascinated by frontend after all.

Currently I'm a frontend developer in a small software company. Seeking for new opportunities and challenges that will expand my skills and continue to develop my competencies further.
